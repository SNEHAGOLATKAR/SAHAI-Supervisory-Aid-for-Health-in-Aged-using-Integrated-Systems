Thus there is a need to provide help to elderly people as well as provide necessary information to their loved ones.

The project is based on kinect device which does not invade their privacy while monitoring multiple elderly people's normal activities and detecting fall or catastrophic conditions by measuring their gait and analyzing change in posture when they change from sitting to walking or vice versa. Support vector machine is used to classify the gait and posture data obtained from the kinect device. Normalization technique is used to identify multiple users and activities.
